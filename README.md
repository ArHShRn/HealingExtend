# HealingExtend
Now released Version0.1.2 !
A collection of healing stuffs containing in a small Mutator, intend to extend the original healing methods

## Healing Extend Mutator : Instant Healing <br>
This is the first mutator containing in HealingExtend Mut<br>
This mutator provides you the possibility to recover Health for a customized health regen rate<br>

## Healing Extend Mutator : Head Shot Recover<br>
his is the second mutator containing in HealingExtend Mut<br>
This mutator provides you the possibility to recover Armour or Health while you just did a single head shot<br>
<br> 
Attention:	You have to do a decap to get the effect !<br>
<br>
If you wanna add it on your server, the mutator is supposed to install on a server which is having less than 16 players due to the structure and the process, I'm working on a better way to do it<br>

## At Last<br>
Plz Email me if you find bugs or if you have any suggestion to what's next in the mutator (only about healing extending stuff) !<br>
