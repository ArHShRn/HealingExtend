# Please Note in BETA 1.0.1 !
Mut's structure is completely re-worked and usage command changes to : <br>
<br>
?Mutator=HealingExtend.HE_Main
<br>
which contains two functions in it: Both Instant Healing & Headshot Recover

# Note: Update Method and Compatibility !
This mut has its own HUD ( you cant close it now because I didn't optimize the condition in code )<br>
please note that <b>IT'S NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ANY MOD (MUT AND GAMEMOD) WITH ITS OWN HUD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</b>

## Update Methods
Whatever side you're (client or server), please completely delete KFHealingExtend.ini in Config folder<br>
Mut's structure has changed and you're supposed to get a new-auto-generated config of this mut<br>
Or <b>IT WILL NOT WORK !!!!</b>

## At Last<br>
Plz Email me if you find bugs or if you have any suggestion to what's next in the mutator (only about healing extending stuff) !<br>
