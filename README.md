# What are the changes in Release 1.0.1 ?
## It adds
-Standard no hud version, back to original experience(but with bugs on health bar because of TWI's coding)<br>
## It removes
-Unstable skill system<br>
Skill systems are removed because they're just at testing and are not stable enough to be in Release ver of the mut.<br>
At Beta version of the mut, there's only one final skill available and it's just written for Medic.Besides, the energy system's energy increment rule is not set properly and it causes some unpleasant experience when the situation goes difficult like when there are many FPs or SCs spawning in the same time. It needs developing for a long time, I expect that it can appear again in Release Ver 2.x mutator<br><br>
-Separated HUD for each perk (though there's only one for medic)
The reason is simple too, separated huds are designed to fit the skill and the energy system, because every perk should have his own special final skill(s) so it's neccessary to write separated huds for them, but since the skill and the energy system are removed from the version, separated hud has no reason to exist either.<br>
<b>But plz note!</b>Medic perk's special HUD stuffs(e.g: health notification) are still working!<br>
## It changes:
-Data structure of the mut<br>
-Config structure of the mut(which means you should <b> Read Update Method carefully</b>!<br>

# Note: Update Method and Compatibility !
This mut has its own HUD, but since some players want playing RPG, so I add one <b>NO HUD VERSION into the mut</b><br>
But if you're still using the HUD version, then please note that <b>IT'S NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ANY MOD (MUT AND GAMEMOD) WITH ITS OWN HUD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</b>

## Update Methods
Whatever side you're (client or server), please completely delete KFHealingExtend.ini in Config folder<br>
Mut's structure has changed and you're supposed to get a new-auto-generated config of this mut<br>
Or <b>IT WILL NOT WORK !!!!</b>

## At Last<br>
Plz Email me if you find bugs or if you have any suggestion to what's next in the mutator (only about healing extending stuff) !<br>
